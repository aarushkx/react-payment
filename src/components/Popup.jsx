                    This website is currently in the development phase and is
                    designed solely for educational and illustrative purposes.
                    Please be aware that the products, prices, and
                    functionalities displayed on this site are not real and are
                    subject to significant changes as the development process
                    continues, particularly with the upcoming integration of a
                    payment system.
                </Typography>
                The current version of the site is intended to showcase
                potential features and design concepts rather than to facilitate
                any actual transactions. Users should not interpret the
                displayed product information or pricing as reflective of
                real-world values or availability. The website's features,
                including but not limited to product listings, pricing, and
                checkout processes, are illustrative and may not represent
                functioning components of a live e-commerce platform.
                <Typography varient="body1" sx={{ mb: 2, mt: 2 }}>
                    As this website progresses towards full functionality, the
                    information provided here may undergo substantial
                    modifications. The integration of a payment gateway and
                    other backend systems will likely alter product details and
                    pricing structures. Therefore, it is crucial to understand
                    that any data presented here should not be used as a basis
                    for real purchases or financial decisions.
                </Typography>
                This platform is intended exclusively for demonstration and
                learning purposes. Users are strongly discouraged from using
                this site for any real transactions or financial activities. The
                current setup does not guarantee the security, accuracy, or
                reliability required for real-world e-commerce operations. Any
                attempts to use this site for actual purchases or financial
                transactions are at the userâ€™s own risk and should be avoided.
